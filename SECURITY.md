# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest stable version is actively supported with critical bug fixed and
security issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be reported to my personal email address (you can check it
from my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/pleonex)).

All the security issues will be analyzed and a reply will be given in two
working days. Once the issue is accepted it will be fixed in the current
development branch and for the latest version. A new version would be released.
